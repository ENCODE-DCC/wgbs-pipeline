The tests contained in this directory will check the output from Loki with
that produced on my test machines.  It should be noted that certain compiler
optimizations can cause non-standard behaviour of the math functions.
Normally these behaviours have little practical effect, but for MCMC
samplers they often lead to large differences in output.  These differences
should not, of course, affect the conclusions drawn from the sampling
output, but they will cause the tests here to fail.  

Therefore, if you want to be able to run Loki on multiple machine
architectures and get *exactly* the same results whichever machine you use,
it is important to select compiler optimizations carefully.  If this is not
important to you then use the fastest optimization options you have.
