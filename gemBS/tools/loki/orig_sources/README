This directory contains the original sources for the Mersenne Twister random
number generator (mt19937.c), and the qsort routine.

Home page for Mersenne Twister: http://www.math.keio.ac.jp/~matumoto/emt.html

The qsort routine came from glibc_2.1.2, the full source of which can be
obtained from any of the GNU sites.  This is used rather than the built in
qsort because in the case where the sort index is not unique, different
qsort routines can return different orders, which will make the answers
different.

ranlib.c in libsrc/ is from the ranlib.c library which is
available from netlib (http://www.netlib.org/random/).

getopt_long.c in libsrc is from the OpenBSD C library source
(http://www.openbsd.org), modified a little to compile on other platforms.

snprintf provides portable snprintf and asprintf functions.  The original
source code is in this directory, and the homepage is
http://www.ijs.si/software/snprintf.  The files snprintf.c and snprintf.h
have been placed in ../libsrc/ and ../include/ respectively, with no changes
being made to these files.
