Debug Malloc Library
********************

Version 5.5.2 - May 2007

The debug memory allocation or "dmalloc" library has been designed as a
drop in replacement for the system's `malloc', `realloc', `calloc',
`free' and other memory management routines while providing powerful
debugging facilities configurable at runtime.  These facilities include
such things as memory-leak tracking, fence-post write detection,
file/line number reporting, and general logging of statistics.

   The library is reasonably portable having been run successfully on at
least the following operating systems: AIX, DGUX, Free/Net/OpenBSD,
GNU/Hurd, HPUX, Irix, Linux, Mac OSX, NeXT, OSF/DUX, SCO, Solaris,
Ultrix, Unixware, MS Windows, and Unicos on a Cray T3E.  It also
provides support for the debugging of threaded programs.  *Note Using
With Threads::.

   The package includes the library, configuration scripts, debug
utility application, test program, and documentation.  Online
documentation as well as the full source is available at URL
`http://dmalloc.com/'.  Details on the library's mailing list are
available there as well.

   Please use the forums at URL `http://dmalloc.com/' to discuss any
problems or to request features.  If you are still having problems, the
author can be reached via his home page at URL `http://256.com/gray/'
with questions or feedback.  Please include the version number of the
library that you are using, your machine and operating system types,
and the value of the DMALLOC_OPTIONS environment variable.

DOCUMENTATION:

Examine the dmalloc.html file which contains the user-documentation
for the dmalloc subsystem.  There also is an dmalloc.info file which
can be installed in the emacs info directory and read with emacs/info
or the info program available from the texinfo package at GNU archive
sites.  It is also suitable for reading as text.  The source of all
documation is the dmalloc.texi texinfo file which also can generate
postscript or TeX hardcopy output with the help of the texinfo.tex
file.  You can download the full documentation package or read it
online from the repository.

ARGV LIBRARY:

My argv library should have been included with this package
(argv.[ch], argv_loc.h).  I use it with all my binaries.  It functions
similar to the getopt routines in that it provides a standardized way
of processing arguments.  However, that is where the similarity ends.
You have to write no C code to do the actual processing, it handles
short -l and long --logfile style options, gives standard short and
long usage messages, and many other features while trying to comply
with POSIX specs.

The newest versions of the argv library are available on the web:

THANKS:

Many net folk contributed to the design, development, and overall
library and my thanks goes out to them all.
