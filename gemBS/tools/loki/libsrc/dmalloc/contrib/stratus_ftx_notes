I recently used your dmalloc library on a Stratus FTX (release
2.3.1.1, i860 Intel processor) system.  Getting the return-address
setup properly was a problem (couldn't get the "asm" working in the
selected compiler mode), and I ended up with compiling according to
full-ANSI rules (using the -Xa compiler option).  This I could only do
after modifying the "dmalloc.h.3" in such a way that the
malloc/calloc/realloc/free definitions would no longer cause the
compiler to bark with 'identifier redeclared' (I just put an #ifdef
_STDLIB_H ... #endif around those functions).
