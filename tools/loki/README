Loki 2.3 - Simon Heath - August 2000

This package contains the source and examples for Loki version 2.3.  Loki
performs Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) multivariate linkage analysis on
general pedigrees.  The current package supports analyses on quantitative
traits only, although this restriction will be lifted in later versions. For
more details see the files in the docs/ subdirectory.  Changes from previous
versions are (sometimes) listed in the Changes file in this directory.

** Making **

Making the package should hopefully just involve typing:

./configure
make

Choices for the C compiler and options can be fixed by setting the shell
environment variables CC and CFLAGS before running ./configure i.e.,

CC=gcc CFLAGS='-O2 -pedantic -Wall -W' ./configure
make

** Testing **

The package has been mostly tested with gcc and GNU make, though it should
work with alternative compilers and make utilities with little or no
modification.  If you have problems compiling please retry with the GNU
tools.  Whether or not this works, please send me an emai at
heath@hardy.mskcc.org to let me know the machine, operating system, compiler
and make utility used, and what error messages were produced.

To run the programs against test datasets with known results, type make
tests.  If you get an output like:

JV test 1
JV test 2
GAW9 test
JV restart test

and no errors reported, then everything was successful.  If not, then type:

make clean
make 2>&1 >error.log

and email the file error.log to me at heath@hardy.mskcc.org, with a
description of the machine you are using (type uname -a), the compiler and
which compiler flags were used.

** Installing **

Installing the package can be done by typing make install.  By default, the
programs and scripts are installed to the bin sub-directory of the main loki
directory.  This behaviour can be changed by giving the --prefix
option to configure.  For example, to install to /usr/local/bin type:

./configure --prefix=/usr/local
